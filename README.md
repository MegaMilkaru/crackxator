# Crackxator

A (web) Crawler and Extractor. The Crackxator!!!

Haha, sorry about the cheesy name (; ^^)

## What is this?

This program is designed to crawl through and extract images from Line's Sticker store pages
(for instance: https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/14903990/en?from=sticker).

## How to use

1: Post the link (IE: https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/14903990/en?from=sticker) into the top bar.

2: Hit "begin operation" and wait.

3: A folder full of the images you were after should be generated in the same directory as the runnable jar.

## Why make this?

Because I thought it would be funny.

## Future plans?

Nope. Got bored.
